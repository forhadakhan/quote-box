# Random Quote Box

This is a simple web application that displays random quotes. Each time you click the "New Quote" button, a new quote will be fetched from the Quotable API and displayed on the screen. You can also save the quote as an image and share it on Twitter.

## Technologies Used

- React
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome

## How It Works

1. The application fetches a random quote from the Quotable API using an HTTP GET request.
2. The quote is displayed in a styled box with the author's name.
3. Clicking the "New Quote" button fetches a new quote from the API and updates the display.
4. Clicking the "Save Quote" button saves the quote as a PNG image.
5. Clicking the "Tweet Quote" button opens a new window to tweet the current quote on Twitter.
